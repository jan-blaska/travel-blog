Exploring new places is one of the best experiences in my life."

                "It was year 2014, I was in my last year of bachelor degree university and I decided to apply for student exchange program called Erasmus. I had literaly no opinion on any city or country but I felt that some southern country would be the best fit. I was hesitating between Spain, Portugal and Turkey but for the first two mentioned, they wanted me to speak Spanish or Portuguese. So it was that, I was preparing for Turkey, specifically city Istanbul ðŸ•Œ.",
                "It was great challenge for me at the beginning because I could barely speak English. Of course, I was learning English since I was a kid but no one actually teached me how to speak. Fortunately I was amongst other students from all the countries of Europe and soon after I was able to communicate with them. I could really experience how my brain become used to another language.",
                "I was lucky to meet students who had great experiences with traveling of any kind. There were people who loved hitchhiking, others loved to jump for the road trips or some people just liked to hangout in the city of Istanbul."
